# bgc_derivation
This is the development branch for an infrastructure agnostic set of common BGC parameter derivation equation functions.

Once validated, they will be published to the https://github.com/argodac GitHub repo, alongside other infrastructure agnostic DAC repos.

This project will initially collate and develop the code for a complete set of derivation equations for:
 - dissolved oxygen
 - pH
 - irradiance
 - chlorophyll fluorescense
 - particle backscatter
 - coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM)

This project will initially write a Matlab version, and aims to develop a Python version as well.

The aim is to provide a toolbox of functions that anyone can make use of, and where no assumptions are made about wider codebase that is in-use.

The definitions of the BGC parameter derivations are based on those specified in the "Processing BGC-Argo XXX at the DAC level" documents available from:
